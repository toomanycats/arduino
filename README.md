# Arduino Makefile

This repository contains a simple Makefile that can be used with many Arudino sketches, so that the sketch may be compiled and uploaded via the command line.
If you dislike the Arduino IDE, this Makefile will help quickly build and upload the sketches.

The Makefile has been tested for use with the latest versions of Arduino and avrdude.

Depending on your purposes, this makefile might also be able to upload a sketch to a raw ATMEL chip via a programmer.

### Latest versions tested:
- Arduino 1.6.5
- avrdude 6.1

## Quick Start

Hook up an Arduino via USB.
Move the Makefile to the root of your Arduino Sketch folder.
Double-check the Makefile and verify the settings are correct for your setup.
In particular, please assure that you:
- Edit the Makefile `PROJECT` variable to reflect the name of the .ino file.
- Edit the `ARDUINO_MODEL` variable to reflect the name of the device you're using
- Edit the `PORT` variable for the communication port (usually /dev/ttyACM\*)
- Add any external libraries that are needed via the `USER_LIBS` and `ARDUINO_LIBS` variables.

Following the edits to the Makefile, you can compile and upload the code via:

```bash
$ make
$ make upload
```
